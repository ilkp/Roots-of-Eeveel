    to our holy form? Sire\u2019s true form has been completed and Iugis has entered
    the halls and truly[...] the scripts have been proven true.\\n\\nIugis has grounded
    herself in the temple and laid her roots across the rooms; they seem healthy and
    growing every day stronger.\\n\\nFollowers have been getting the same symptoms
    as Sire did and so have I. We have never felt this much energy residing in our
    bodies. Our goddess blessed us with this power and once we have gone through the
    process we will assist Iugis in her glorious battle and get to the promised paradise.
