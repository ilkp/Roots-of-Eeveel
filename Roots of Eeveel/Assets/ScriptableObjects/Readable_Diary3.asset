  UIText: "June 12th\\n\\nThere has been some[...] unexpected changes to Sire. His
    orders and behavior have become irrational. Others have seen him wander around
    at night and he spends the daytime standing in the light. Few days ago he ordered
    the ceiling of his bedroom to be broken until light could directly point to where
    he sleeps, if he even does that. His eyes have become bloodshot, the veins from
    his bicep have reached his face and his skin is turning hard and dry.\\n\\nSometimes
    I wonder if we even know if he is present anymore of if we are talking to the
    Goddess herself.  [The text here is incomprehensible, it seems that some liquid
    has been poured into these pages turning the ink blurry. (Player\u2019s character:
    \u201CThe ink here is blurry[...], I\u2019m unable to read these pages\u201D)]"
