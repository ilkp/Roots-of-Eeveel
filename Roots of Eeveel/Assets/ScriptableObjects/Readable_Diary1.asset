  UIText: "May 29th\\n\\nFor years now our Sire has had a peculiar interest in the
    small corpse of an ant he found while he was tending our garden. And the years
    after this discovery he has researched the ants around the mansion as it seems
    there is a specific type of fungus that grows out of them. He believes this is
    a sign from our beloved Iugis, her message to us to tell how to proceed from now
    on.\\n\\nToday he came to me asking to inject this fungus into him. He wants to
    become a vessel for Iugis. He says she has tried to get her plan started but tiny
    ant vessels can barely hold her being in them and these corpses have been spread
    around our mansion to send us a message. He is dedicated follower and our leader.
    If anyone should be containing Iugis\u2019 glorious being, it should be him.\\n\\nAnd
    for that reason I did what he asked. There were no signs yet. We\u2019ll proceed
    to journal his process."
