  - "I\u016Bgis, Goddess of the nature, born from the intestines of Panton, suffered
    under God of All, fled and was punished for eternal starvation,"
  - consumed until there was nothing but herself, was put under ground by Panton,
    rose as trees back to earth, looks the world through cut branches as trapped,
  - waits for Panton, God of all-seeing to blink, strikes to claim her new seat, as
    God of All, as the righteous leader of ours,
  - we believe in her resurrection, the freedom from gluttony, in the glory of nature
    and the eternal life residing in her roots.
