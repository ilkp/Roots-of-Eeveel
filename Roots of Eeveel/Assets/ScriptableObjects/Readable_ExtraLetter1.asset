  UIText: "For my dearest Hogsmith\\n\\nOur sire has again shared his neverending
    wisdom and thoughts about nature and its ability to rebuild and create. His observations
    of our culture has assured him that sometimes a crude transformation must take
    place in order to achieve something more meaningful.\\n\\nHe used this insect-pathogenic
    fungus as an example of this process. The fungus destroys the hosts ability to
    control itself and ultimately the host will be nothing more than a nourishment
    for the fungus.\\n\\nSire has also been talking a lot about the fall of man and
    how we may revert this tragic event.\\n\\nLet I\u016Bgis ground her roots on you "
