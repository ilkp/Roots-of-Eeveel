  UIText: Iugis, Goddess of the nature, born from the intestines of Panton, suffered
    under God of All, fled and was punished for eternal starvation, consumed until
    there was nothing but herself, was put under ground by Panton, rose as trees back
    to earth, looks the world through cut branches as trapped, waits for Panton, God
    of all-seeing to blink, strikes to claim her new seat, as God of All, as the righteous
    leader of ours, we believe in her resurrection, the freedom from gluttony, in
    the glory of nature and the eternal life residing in her roots.
