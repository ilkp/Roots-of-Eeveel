  UIText: 'Our newest followers,\n\nWe as a community serve our loved Iugis to uplift
    her to raise above the god of injustice Panton, slay him and claim her throne
    as the true goddess of nature.\n\nWe pray together and enter the temple as the
    one true community. As the first steps in front of the door, so does one by their
    side. But the first one is no greater than the last who will listen to the prayers
    before them and ending the prayer. As the last walks the longest, they will hold
    the power of Ignis in them and as last to enter the room, they will close the
    doors to protect the holy ritual from the outsiders.\n\nFollow our rules and with
    these Iugis will ground her roots on you, '
