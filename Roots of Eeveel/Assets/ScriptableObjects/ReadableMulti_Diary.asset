  - "May 29th\\n\\nFor years now our Sire has had a peculiar interest in the small
    corpse of an ant he found while he was tending our garden. And the years after
    this discovery he has researched the ants around the mansion as it seems there
    is a specific type of fungus that grows out of them. He believes this is a sign
    from our beloved Iugis, her message to us to tell how to proceed from now on.\\n\\nToday
    he came to me asking to inject this fungus into him. He wants to become a vessel
    for Iugis. He says she has tried to get her plan started but tiny ant vessels
    can barely hold her being in them and these corpses have been spread around our
    mansion to send us a message. He is dedicated follower and our leader. If anyone
    should be containing Iugis\u2019 glorious being, it should be him."
  - "And for that reason I did what he asked. There were no signs yet. We\u2019ll
    proceed to journal his process.\\n\\n\\nJune 5th\\n\\nSire\u2019s health seems
    to have increased. He says he feels like he is back to the health he had when
    he was young. No signs of fatigue is seen in him, he truly is the greatest vessel
    to be. The veins on the arm that was injected is starting to turn black. We will
    inspect this but I am sure the spirit of Iugis will keep him in health."
  - "June 12th\\n\\nThere has been some[...] unexpected changes to Sire. His orders
    and behavior have become irrational. Others have seen him wander around at night
    and he spends the daytime standing in the light. Few days ago he ordered the ceiling
    of his bedroom to be broken until light could directly point to where he sleeps,
    if he even does that. His eyes have become bloodshot, the veins from his bicep
    have reached his face and his skin is turning hard and dry.\\n\\nSometimes I wonder
    if we even know if he is present anymore of if we are talking to the Goddess herself.

  - July [Date unreadable]\n\nHis skin seems dry and chipping, bumpy and textured
    from the hardened skin, discolouration has spread across his body and no healthy
    color is left in Sire. His[...] limbs have elongated, fingers longer than forearms
    and even those[...], there is no part of him that has not stretched.\n\nThe doubt
    has plagued my mind about this[...] but we must proceed, maybe Iugis is closer
    to us than we believe.
  - "July 26th\\n\\nSire no longer talks, we can communicate with him through grunts,
    handmaiden Aurus has tried teaching sign language but it seems he is unable to
    move his fingers in the way humans do.\\n\\nMaiden washed his back today and saw
    an eye there and indeed when I went to look, there was a pupil like cat\u2019s
    staring at me. As it stared at me I could feel that it knew me better than anyone
    else. It is now true[...]; Iugis has ground her roots on us.\\n\\nAugust 2nd\\n\\nIs
    it an illness or just the painful process to being closer to our holy form? Sire\u2019s
    true form has been completed and Iugis has entered the halls and truly[...] the
    scripts have been proven true."
  - "Iugis has grounded herself in the temple and laid her roots across the rooms;
    they seem healthy and growing every day stronger.\\n\\nFollowers have been getting
    the same symptoms as Sire did and so have I. We have never felt this much energy
    residing in our bodies. Our goddess blessed us with this power and once we have
    gone through the process we will assist Iugis in her glorious battle and get to
    the promised paradise.  [All the text from now on is unreadable. Pages and pages
    full of text that makes no sense. (Player\u2019s character: \u201CI can\u2019t
    read further[...] The text makes no sense anymore[...] They speak about being
    in pain and not wanting to do this anymore but change their mind in seconds[...].
    What happened to these people?\u201D)]"
